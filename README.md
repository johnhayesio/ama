Have a question about anything? Ask away... This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal. Health. Wealth. Life. Code. :joy:

 - :memo:&nbsp; Use a succinct title and description.
 - :bug:&nbsp; Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
 - :signal_strength:&nbsp; Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
 - :blush:&nbsp; Be nice, civil and polite.
 - :heart_eyes:&nbsp; If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will
   probably come faster.
